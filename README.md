## Challenge 4 - Web APIs Quiz

This program was designed to conduct a quiz on Web APIs as per the requirements of Challenge 4.

Clicking start will initiate the quiz, giving the user 60 seconds to complete it. 

Wrong answers will subtract 5 seconds from the timer. Correct answers will add to the score.

At the end of the quiz, the user has the opportunity to input a name to save along with their score. The program then prints a list of high scores to date, which
are saved in the local storage.

There is also a button to clear the high scores and start anew, which clears the local storage.
